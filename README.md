Space Invader was the first game that came into my mind, when I needed to program a game for an assigment on Object-Oriented Programming. So I sat down and wrote it. It took I think around 40-50 hours to complete it. 

Goal of the game is pretty simple: protect the earth (bottom of the window) from aliens coming from the top. And not to die. Aliens shoot laser beams, just as the player does.

Player can move on the bottom line and shoot.

Game features different kinds of aliens, each with unique fighting style. There is also plenty of bonuses, that sometimes appear after destroying an enemy. Bonuses can simply give player more points (golden with $ sign), protect him from the coming aliens (blue with protection sphere), repair broken hull of the ship (red with a heart), slow down time (green with clock) or increse firepower (silver with double laser beams).

As an additional feature, I created a working leaderboard, using simple text file.
